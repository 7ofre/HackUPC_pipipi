# The goal of this project is to facilitate connections for travelers in their destination cities and curate personalized activities based on shared interests. What needs to be accomplished is that our travelers' experiences trascend mere logistics and foster meaningful connections and enriching activities. Through a user-friendly website interface, travelers will be able to pinpoint their destination city on a world map to access tailored information. This information will include details about fellow travelers they will meet, the duration of their stay, and a schedule of planned activities. Central to this experience is the cultivation of conenections: travelers will discover like-minded individuals with whom to share their journey. In essence, our aim is to transform business trips into enjoyable experiences, enriching each journey one step at a time.
